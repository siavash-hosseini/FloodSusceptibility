# FloodSusceptibility
Extreme weather threatens grid infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, where logistical challenges and limited resources hinder electrification and decarbonization efforts. This paper introduces a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach aimed at identifying investment strategies, operational flexibility, and risk mitigation to improve the resilience of electrification systems in regions at risk from environmental hazards. The proposed method incorporates environmental factors such as wind speed, rainfall, and flood risk at 61 different stations. A Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) analysis is utilized to pinpoint high-risk scenarios and establish cost-effective preventive strategies. We focused on critical assets, such as transformers, for reinforcement in areas with limited access and developed a framework to strengthen electrification systems in vulnerable regions, ensuring operational continuity and resilience during extreme weather conditions. The findings indicate that the model successfully addresses environmental risks while keeping costs to a minimum.
